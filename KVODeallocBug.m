In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can occur due to the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management. If an observer is not properly removed before the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This often happens when an observer is added in a method that might not always be paired with a corresponding removal method (e.g., view controller's `viewDidLoad` adding the observer without `viewWillDisappear` removing it).
