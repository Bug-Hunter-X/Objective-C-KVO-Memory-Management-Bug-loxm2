This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Improper removal of KVO observers before the observed object is deallocated can lead to crashes and unexpected behavior. The `KVODeallocBug.m` file showcases this issue. The `KVOSolution.m` file provides a corrected implementation that prevents this memory management problem, highlighting best practices for handling KVO observers.
